        <h4>Love your Mom The best that you can</h4>
        <p>Always Love your Mom Anytime and Anywhere. Everytime you get up from sleep to go to school, they are the one
          who is responsible for preparing your needs in school. They cook, They wash, They sanitize for you and for
          your entire family. Make some time to say "I love you" or "Thank you" to them. and pray for more safety,
          strength and durability for them. So that, they can continue their responsibilities as a parent of yours.
          Their are humans too. They suffer a lot of problems and everyday trying to find some possible solutions. They
          sometimes discriminated and humilited and they swallow their pride just to ensure your good life. Respect them
          as well. Being rude to your mother make them upset and mad sometimes of course. aside of that, it will drain
          them mentally and physically.</p>

        Your Mom needs your prayer too. they need protection, guide, strength and good health. Always remember
        thattheir
        life are limited and their time are already calculated. Be mindful that Mom's are best in terms of house
        works, or
        taking care of you or the entire family. but, they also need to be cared as well.
        Remember, everytime you have a problem, your Mom will always be the first to approach on you.
