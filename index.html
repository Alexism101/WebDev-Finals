          one
          will take care of you first. until such time, yourself knows how to walk with your own. Our parents always
          want to prove themselves
          by doing things such as finding a job, or taking care of you in your childhood, etc. not because it's their
          responsibility but because,
          they always want to prove in to us the love that they have.</p>

        <p>Always Love your Mom Anytime and Anywhere. Everytime you get up from sleep to go to school, they are the one
          who is responsible for preparing your needs in school. They cook, They wash, They sanitize for you and for
          your entire family. Make some time to say "I love you" or "Thank you" to them. and pray for more safety,
          strength and durability for them. So that, they can continue their responsibilities as a parent of yours.
          Their are humans too. They suffer a lot of problems and everyday trying to find some possible solutions. They
          sometimes discriminated and humilited and they swallow their pride just to ensure your good life. Respect them
          as well. Being rude to your mother make them upset and mad sometimes of course. aside of that, it will drain
          them mentally and physically.</p>
